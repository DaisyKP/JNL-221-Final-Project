  <title>Dissecting The Rise in Anti-Jewish Hate Crimes in New York City

<h1>Dissecting The Rise in Anti-Jewish Hate Crimes in New York City</h1>

<p><strong> By Daisy Polowetzky</strong><p>

  Between the years of 2019 and 2024, the majority of hate crime arrests made by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), were related to anti-Jewish bias. According to hate crime data collected by the NYPD, more than 40 percent of hate crimes were motivated by antisemitism. This is in comparison to hate crimes motivated by homophobia and race-based bias. Considering the Jewish population of New York City is over one million people–the largest population outside of Israel according to The Jewish Chronicle–this data is particularly concerning.

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum defines antisemitism as “prejudice against or hatred of Jews.” While antisemitism has plagued nations for centuries, contemporary acts of antisemitism tend to be motivated by criticism of Israel and its conflict with Palestine, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Some individuals feel that by targeting Israel, they are also entitled to target the Jewish religion and related institutions.</p>
<p>“The Jews are the scapegoat of history,” said Linda Wyetzner, an attorney and born-and-raised New Yorker. “We are this teeny, weeny, little, itsy-bitsy percentage of the population. Surely, we do not have that big of an impact on anything.”</p>
<p>Looking at the NYPD data on an even more filtered level, the majority of anti-Jewish hate crimes were classified as felonies, meaning convicted perpetrators could face prison time. The same NYPD data shows that over 50 percent of anti-Jewish hate crimes were documented as felonies under the NYPD’s law code. The prison time for assault, like many of the hate crimes were, can range from one to twenty-five years depending on the degree of the crime.</p>

<h2>The Data in Real Life</h2>
<p>In 2024, NBC News reported that a 22-year-old Brooklyn man was charged with assault in connection with an anti-semetic hate crime after he stabbed a man outside of a synagogue. That same year, The New York Post reported that a man punched Jonathan Lederer, a Jewish Columbia University student, at an anti-Israel protest after also accusing him of being a Nazi. These are just some of the many hate crime incidents that have instilled a sense of fear and unease among Jewish New Yorkers, esspecially students. 
</p>
<p>The Anti-Defamation League’s 2025 Campus Antisemitism Report Card identified and graded 20 colleges and universities in New York State based on their efforts to respond to antisemitism on their campuses. Eight of these colleges or universities were located in New York City, including Columbia University, The New School, and Barnard College. All three of these institutions were ranked below expectations when it came to their rating for campus conduct and climate concerns. Even before the report was published, Columbia’s antisimitism task force had urged the administration to do more to protect Jewish students, according to the New York Times. 
</p>  

<p>While President Trump signed an executive order in January to counter the spread of antisemetism on college campuses, Trump also simultaneously defunded federal organizations like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), according to ProPublica. Organizations like FEMA aid Jewish communities with security resources they desperately need now more than ever. FEMA-funded window film protected the Jewish Family Services offices in Denver from gunfire during an attack in 2021. And in 2023, FEMA-funded access-control doors protected a Memphis Hebrew school from a gunman.   
</p>

<p>“Trump is defunding all of the federal entities that watch anti-Semitism and do something about anti-Semitism,” Wyetzner said. “He yips and yaps about [antisemitism], … but it’s all phoney…”
”</p>


<p>In response to the uptick in attacks on the Jewish community, organizations such as the United Jewish Appeal Federation of New York have come together to form The Community Security Initiative. The initiative, in partnership with the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, and the Jewish Federation and Foundation of Rockland County, aims to increase security for Jewish populations in the New York metro area through local law enforcement, web security, and self-defense. Other organizations such as Jews For Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ), center their work on creating educational curriculum, and countering white Christian nationalism and far-right groups through voting initiatives. JFREJ also helped fto ound the Jews Against White Nationalism project to tackle antisemitism by starting in the voting booth.</p>


<p>There may not be a one step solution for eliminating antisemitic incidents in New York City, but,  for now, the New York City Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes continues to work closely with the NYPD and the Department of Education to protect victims of hate crimes, provide resources, and educate young people on the effects of bigotry.
